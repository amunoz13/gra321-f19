    <h1>Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railway</h1>
      <h2>Ninety years after their creation, two of Walt Disney's most beloved characters are getting their own attraction at Walt Disney World.</h2>
    <p>Kevin Rafferty, one of the executive creative directors at Walt Disney Imagineering, has been working on attractions at Disney theme parks, in his words, "for a long, looong time. Ive worked on many attractions, and when something is really special, I get a strong gut feeling - and that's what I feel on this one." He's talking about <i>Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railway,</i> a forthcoming attraction at Disney's Hollywood Studios near Orlando, slated to welcome guests in 2019. And he's not the only one who's excited.</p>
    <p>"I had the privilege over the past couple of years working in a lab environment where we're looking at building new tools and techniques for our designers to tell stories," says Charita Carter, a senior creative producer and development manager of the Scenic Illusion team. "So when an opportunity presented itself to create the first Mickey and Minnie attraction, it made sense to look at all the tools and techniques we have available to us."</p>
    <p>But first they had to create a concept. According to Rafferty, most ideas within Imagineering start with a simple question: what if? "We asked ourselves, 'What if we put Mickey inside the Chinese Theatre at Disney's Hollywood Studios? What if you could ride inside a Mickey short?'" Those questions, and the technological advancements required to bring their answers to life, led to the creation of an attraction that is as innovative as it is timeless, with surprises around every corner. "We are placing our guests inside the short," says Carter. "They'll be able to experience what it's like to live inside Mickey and Minnie's wacky world."</p>
    <p>Creating that world presented some welcome challenges, as well as a chance to dig into the core of what fans have always loved about Mickey and Minnie.</p>
    <p>"It's obviously  complete honor to be able to work on an attraction like this, but also very daunting," says Carter. "We were bringing forth these iconic characters, which gave us a good excuse to go back and crawl through the years to get to the best of everything. We wanted to stay true to the classic execution - the things we do that make Disney Disney - while making sure that every tool and technique and methodology was brought to bear on this because Mickey and Minnie are worth it. So we threw our net broadly to ensure we could execute this."</p>
    <p>Rafferty adds that unlike attractions based around other Disney characters, Mickey and Minnie didn't arrive with a built-in world for the Imagineers to create. "Anna and Else come with Arendelle. Mater and Lightning McQueen come with Radiator Springs. And there are expectations that come with that from our guests," says Rafferty. "But the biggest surprise was realizing that our guests don't know what to expect with this attraction because it's brand-new and they don't know what the story is and they've never seen anything like it." As such, an original story as well as an all-new attraction theme song were created specifically for the ride, and cutting-edge technologies were utilized to make the cartoon world of the recent Mickey and Minnie shorts come to life. "The backgrounds, the style, the off-register flatness of the world, the edgy design of the characters and the fun that goes with that - anything goes." says Rafferty. "Anything can happen."</p>
    <p>Desipte using the most modern iterations of the classic characters as the basis of the attraction's design, both Carter and Rafferty feel fans of all ages, as well as from future generations, will fall in love with the way they're presented in <i>Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railway.</i> "Over the years, Mickey, from <i>Steamboat Willie</i> on, has has so many different looks but no matter what he's looked like or how he's been styled, he's always the same loveable Mickey," says Rafferty. "This attraction will live on - even though it's styled to look like the current Mickey shorts - it'll be timeless. Plus, Mickey and Minnie are equal partners in our attraction. They help each other out, they work together, and they're a team. And you'll see how that all plays out when we open the attraction."</p>
    <p>While Carter and Rafferty were both careful not to reveal too much about the attraction, both agreed on one thing: There's never been anything like it.</p>
    <p> <i>Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railway</i> will be accessible to park guests at Disney's Hollywood Studios in late 2019.</p>
