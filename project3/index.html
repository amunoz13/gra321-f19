    <h1>Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railway</h1>
      <h2>Ninety years after their creation, two of Walt Disney's most beloved characters are getting their own attraction at Walt Disney World.</h2>
    <p>Kevin Rafferty, one of the executive creative directors at Walt Disney Imagineering, has been working on attractions at Disney theme parks, in his words, "for a long, looong time. Ive worked on many attractions, and when something is really special, I get a strong gut feeling - and that's what I feel on this one." He's talking about <i>Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railway,</i> a forthcoming attraction at Disney's Hollywood Studios near Orlando, slated to welcome guests in 2019. And he's not the only one who's excited.</p>
