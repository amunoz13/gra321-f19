    <h1>Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railway</h1>
      <h2>Ninety years after their creation, two of Walt Disney's most beloved characters are getting their own attraction at Walt Disney World.</h2>
    <p>Kevin Rafferty, one of the executive creative directors at Walt Disney Imagineering, has been working on attractions at Disney theme parks, in his words, "for a long, looong time. Ive worked on many attractions, and when something is really special, I get a strong gut feeling - and that's what I feel on this one." He's talking about <i>Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railway,</i> a forthcoming attraction at Disney's Hollywood Studios near Orlando, slated to welcome guests in 2019. And he's not the only one who's excited.</p>
    <p>"I had the privilege over the past couple of years working in a lab environment where we're looking at building new tools and techniques for our designers to tell stories," says Charita Carter, a senior creative producer and development manager of the Scenic Illusion team. "So when an opportunity presented itself to create the first Mickey and Minnie attraction, it made sense to look at all the tools and techniques we have available to us."</p>
    <p>But first they had to create a concept. According to Rafferty, most ideas within Imagineering start with a simple question: what if? "We asked ourselves, 'What if we put Mickey inside the Chinese Theatre at Disney's Hollywood Studios? What if you could ride inside a Mickey short?'" Those questions, and the technological advancements required to bring their answers to life, led to the creation of an attraction that is as innovative as it is timeless, with surprises around every corner. "We are placing our guests inside the short," says Carter. "They'll be able to experience what it's like to live inside Mickey and Minnie's wacky world."</p>
