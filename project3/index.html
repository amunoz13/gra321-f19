    <h1>Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railway</h1>
      <h2>Ninety years after their creation, two of Walt Disney's most beloved characters are getting their own attraction at Walt Disney World.</h2>
    <p>Kevin Rafferty, one of the executive creative directors at Walt Disney Imagineering, has been working on attractions at Disney theme parks, in his words, "for a long, looong time. Ive worked on many attractions, and when something is really special, I get a strong gut feeling - and that's what I feel on this one." He's talking about <i>Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railway,</i> a forthcoming attraction at Disney's Hollywood Studios near Orlando, slated to welcome guests in 2019. And he's not the only one who's excited.</p>
    <p>"I had the privilege over the past couple of years working in a lab environment where we're looking at building new tools and techniques for our designers to tell stories," says Charita Carter, a senior creative producer and development manager of the Scenic Illusion team. "So when an opportunity presented itself to create the first Mickey and Minnie attraction, it made sense to look at all the tools and techniques we have available to us."</p>
